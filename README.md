SecureCRT Scripts
==================
SecureCRT Python scripts for doing various tasks on Cisco equipment.

These have been testing using SecureCRT 7.1 on OSX Mavericks.

You will need to modify the scripts to have a valid output directory for your particular machine.

Scripts:
========
SaveRunning.py - Captures the running config to a file, named based on the prompt and current date.
SaveCDPasCSV.py - Captures CDP information and saves the important info to a CSV file
