Multiple Device Scripts
=======================

Multiple Device Scripts are scripts that are designed to be executed while NOT attached to a remote device.   The script will prompt for an input CSV containing all of the hosts and other required details (credentials, jumpbox, etc) to be able to connect all of the devices in the list automatically.   The logic of the script will be performed on each device, one at a time.
