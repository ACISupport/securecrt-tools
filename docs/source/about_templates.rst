About Templates
=========================================

The `templates` folder contains empty script files that can be used as a tempalte for either single-device or multi-device scripts.  These templates should contain all of the boiler-plate code necessary (which I've tried to keep to a minimum) to make the scripts function properly.

The idea is that you can use these templates to more quickly write a script by simply filling in your code/logic into the areas marked with "Put you code here" in the comments.
